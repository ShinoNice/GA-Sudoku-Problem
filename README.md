# GA-Sudoku-Problem

Welcome to the optimization of sudokus using Genetic Algorithms project! This project was developed as part of the CIFO course for the 2023/2024 academic year. The objective is to use Genetic Algorithms to evolve solutions to a Sudoku problem

## Project Overview
The primary objective of the project is to use GAs to evolve solutions to a Sudoku problem. Thinking about how to represent such a problem, and how to design a fitness function and appropriate genetic operators. We wanted to be able to find good solutions- ideally solving Sudoku problems completely. Compare the algorithmâ€™s performance on different difficulty levels and comment on those.

## Results
The final algorithm's performance and key findings are detailed in the `CIFO_Report.pdf`.

Happy coding!
